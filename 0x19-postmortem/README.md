**Postmortem: ALX's System Engineering & DevOps Project 0x19 Outage**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: Approximately 06:00 West African Time (WAT)
  - End Time: Resolved by 19:30 PST on the same day

- **Impact:**
  - GET requests to the Apache web server on an isolated Ubuntu 14.04 container resulted in 500 Internal Server Errors.
  - Expected response, a simple Holberton WordPress site, was not served.
  - Isolated incident on a specific container, affecting local development environment.

- **Root Cause:**
  - A typo in the wp-settings.php file, where a file class-wp-locale.phpp was referenced instead of class-wp-locale.php.

**Timeline:**

- **06:00 WAT:** Outage detected, GET requests on the Apache server resulting in 500 Internal Server Errors.
- **19:20 PST:** Brennan (BDB) assigned to debug the issue.
- **19:25 PST:** Checked running processes, identified Apache processes, and reviewed sites-available configuration.
- **19:30 PST:** Initiated strace on Apache processes. Identified an ENOENT error on /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.
- **19:35 PST:** Located the typo in wp-settings.php, removed the trailing 'p' from the file extension.
- **19:40 PST:** Tested server response with curl, confirmed resolution with a 200 status.
- **19:45 PST:** Wrote Puppet manifest (0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) to automate fixing similar errors.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - Typo in wp-settings.php, referencing class-wp-locale.phpp instead of the correct class-wp-locale.php.

- **Resolution:**
  - Removed the trailing 'p' from the erroneous file extension in wp-settings.php.
  - Automated the fix using a Puppet manifest for future prevention.

**Prevention:**

- **Testing:**
  - Emphasized the importance of thorough testing before deployment to catch such errors early in the development process.

- **Status Monitoring:**
  - Recommended the use of uptime-monitoring services like UptimeRobot to promptly alert on website outages.

- **Automation:**
  - Introduced a Puppet manifest (0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) to automate the identification and correction of similar errors in the future.

**Summation:**

In essence, the outage was caused by a simple typo in the wp-settings.php file, leading to a critical error in the application. The swift resolution involved manual correction, followed by the creation of a Puppet manifest to automate fixing similar errors. To prevent future occurrences, rigorous testing before deployment, status monitoring, and automation of error fixes were highlighted as key strategies.

The incident serves as a reminder that even seasoned programmers can overlook minor details, emphasizing the need for a robust testing and monitoring framework to maintain the reliability of web applications.
